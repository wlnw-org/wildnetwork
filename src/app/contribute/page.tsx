          minutes. If you don&apos;t have one yet, this page shows what to get and how to set it up. It is free, and you keep the rights to your data.

        <p>
          WildNetwork reads BirdWeather&apos;s public detections (never the recordings). If you have a BirdWeather PUC, or your BirdNET-Pi or BirdNET-Go station uploads to BirdWeather,
          your detections are on the map and in every measure. <b>Do not install the agent as well:</b> the same detections would arrive twice and be counted twice.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Not sure? Look for your station on <A href="https://app.birdweather.com">app.birdweather.com</A>. If it is there, you are included.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          Want more say in how your station appears? <Link href="/stations/join" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">Opt it in</Link>: choose a name or stay anonymous,
          pick how precisely it is located, and share its full daily counts in the open data releases under your licence.
        </p>

        <H2 id="have">I have a device</H2>
        <p>
          You install one small program, <A href={AGENT}>wdx-agent</A>, on the computer that holds your detections. It is a single open source Python file with no
          dependencies. It reads what your detector has already found and sends it. It never changes your detector&apos;s files, and it catches up by itself after
          being offline.
        </p>

        <H3 id="birdnet-pi">BirdNET-Pi</H3>
        <p>Open a terminal on the Pi (or connect with SSH) and run:</p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -fsSL ${SITE}/agent/install.sh | bash`}</CopyBlock>
        <p>
          The installer finds BirdNET-Pi&apos;s database, registers your station, and starts a background service. It uses the location you set in BirdNET-Pi. That is all.
        </p>

        <H3 id="birdnet-go">BirdNET-Go</H3>
        <p>Run the same command on the machine that runs BirdNET-Go:</p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -fsSL ${SITE}/agent/install.sh | bash`}</CopyBlock>
        <p>If it cannot find the database, tell it where <code className="text-slate-200">birdnet.db</code> is:</p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -fsSL ${SITE}/agent/install.sh | WDX_SOURCE=birdnet-go WDX_PATH=/path/to/birdnet.db bash`}</CopyBlock>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Works with both BirdNET-Go database layouts, the current one and the original one. Detections BirdNET-Go marks as unlikely for your location are skipped.</p>

        <H3 id="camera">Camera trap</H3>
        <p>
          Cameras take pictures; a classifier names the animals. Run <A href="https://github.com/google/cameratrapai">SpeciesNet</A> over your images, then point the
          agent at the folder with its results. A camera has no GPS in the result file, so give its location:
        </p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -fsSL ${SITE}/agent/install.sh | WDX_SOURCE=speciesnet WDX_PATH=/data/camtrap WDX_LAT=11.41 WDX_LON=76.69 bash`}</CopyBlock>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Blank images, people and vehicles are never sent. One agent serves one location, so use one setup per camera site.</p>
        <p>
          <b>Want a person to check the results first?</b> Use <A href="https://github.com/arunrajiah/speciesnet-studio">SpeciesNet Studio</A> instead of the agent: it runs
          SpeciesNet, lets you confirm, correct or flag each image, and sends the reviewed results here from its Export dialog, marked as confirmed by a reviewer. Get its key
          with:
        </p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -X POST ${SITE}/api/v1/register \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"name":"my-camera-site","source":"speciesnet-studio"}'`}</CopyBlock>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">Use one route per camera: the agent sends unchecked predictions automatically, Studio sends checked ones.</p>

        <H3 id="bat">Bat detector</H3>
        <p>
          Record with an ultrasonic recorder, classify the recordings with <A href="https://github.com/macaodha/batdetect2">BatDetect2</A>, and point the agent at the
          results folder:
        </p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -fsSL ${SITE}/agent/install.sh | WDX_SOURCE=batdetect2 WDX_PATH=/data/bats/results WDX_LAT=51.51 WDX_LON=-0.13 bash`}</CopyBlock>
        <p className="text-sm text-slate-400">
          BatDetect2&apos;s default model knows UK species. Elsewhere, use a model trained for your region, or the names will be wrong.
        </p>

        <H3 id="csv">Other software (Kaleidoscope, SonoBat and similar)</H3>
        <p>
          If your software can export a table of detections, the agent can read it. You tell it which columns hold the species, the time and the score. The{" "}
          <A href={`${AGENT}#any-detections-table-csv`}>CSV guide</A> has a worked example.
        </p>

        <H3 id="api">Your own detector or code</H3>
        <p>Send detections straight to the API in the open <A href="https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildlife-detection-exchange">WDX</A> format. Get a key, then post events:</p>
        <CopyBlock>{`curl -X POST ${SITE}/api/v1/register \\
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \\
  -d '{"name":"my-station","source":"other"}'

curl -X POST ${SITE}/api/v1/events \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer wn_YOUR_KEY" \\
  -H "content-type: application/x-ndjson" \\
  --data-binary @events.wdx.ndjson`}</CopyBlock>

        <p>Three kinds of station, from easiest to most involved. Each links to the maker&apos;s own guide for the build, then you come back here to connect it.</p>

        <H3 id="new-bird">A bird listening station</H3>
        <p>The most popular way to start. It sits in a garden or on a balcony and identifies birds by their song, all day, every day.</p>
        <Steps items={[
          <><b>Get the parts:</b> a Raspberry Pi (4B, 5, 3B+ or Zero 2 W), a microSD card of 32 GB or more, a USB microphone (or a USB sound card with a small lavalier microphone), and a power supply. For outdoors, add a weatherproof box.</>,
          <><b>Install the listening software:</b> follow the <A href="https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi">BirdNET-Pi</A> guide, or <A href="https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go">BirdNET-Go</A> if you prefer. Set your latitude and longitude in its settings.</>,
          <><b>Let it listen for a day</b> and check that it is identifying birds in its own web page.</>,
          <><b>Connect it:</b> run the <a href="#birdnet-pi" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">one line install</a> above.</>,
        ]} />
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-slate-400">
          Prefer something ready made? A <A href="https://www.birdweather.com">BirdWeather PUC</A> is a finished device that reports to BirdWeather, and so to WildNetwork, with nothing to build.
        </p>

        <H3 id="new-bat">A bat detector</H3>
        <p>Bats call above the range of human hearing, so you need a recorder that captures ultrasound.</p>
        <Steps items={[
          <><b>Get a recorder:</b> an <A href="https://www.openacousticdevices.info/audiomoth">AudioMoth</A> is the common low cost choice. Set it to a sample rate of 250 kHz or more and schedule it from dusk to dawn.</>,
          <><b>Put it out</b> near water, a hedge line or a woodland edge, a few metres up, away from rustling leaves.</>,
          <><b>Collect the recordings</b> and copy them to a computer.</>,
          <><b>Classify them</b> with <A href="https://github.com/macaodha/batdetect2">BatDetect2</A>, which writes a result file for each recording.</>,
          <><b>Connect it:</b> run the <a href="#bat" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">bat detector install</a> above, pointing at the results folder.</>,
        ]} />

        <H3 id="new-camera">A camera trap</H3>
        <p>For mammals and ground birds. A camera takes a picture when something moves in front of it.</p>
        <Steps items={[
          <><b>Get a trail camera</b> and an SD card. Any model that saves ordinary photos works.</>,
          <><b>Mount it</b> at about knee height on a game trail or by water, facing north or south to avoid direct sun, with nothing moving in front.</>,
          <><b>Collect the card</b> every few weeks and copy the images to a computer. Keep the file dates when copying, since the agent uses them as the time of each sighting.</>,
          <><b>Classify the images</b> with <A href="https://github.com/google/cameratrapai">SpeciesNet</A>.</>,
          <><b>Connect it:</b> run the <a href="#camera" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">camera trap install</a> above with the camera&apos;s location.</>,

          <li><b>What is sent:</b> species, time, confidence, the rounded location, the classifier&apos;s name, the file name of the clip or photo, and a station id. <b>Not sent:</b> the audio or the photos themselves.</li>
          <li><b>No account.</b> The installer registers a key for your device. A station name is optional.</li>
          <li><b>You choose the license.</b> The default is CC BY 4.0, which lets others use your detections with credit.</li>
          <li><b>Sensitive species.</b> If your station records a threatened species at a known site, use the coarser rounding or leave that station out.</li>
          <li><b>Stopping and removal.</b> Uninstall at any time with the commands in the <A href={`${AGENT}#uninstall`}>agent guide</A>. To have your station&apos;s data removed, <A href="https://github.com/wlnw-org/wildnetwork/issues/new">open an issue</A> with your station id (it is in the first line of the agent&apos;s log).</li>
