          If your station reports to BirdWeather, a sample of its detections is already on the map, at an approximate position and without its name. Opting in
          puts you in control of more: your station appears on the <Link href="/stations" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">stations page</Link> under a name you
          choose (or none), and its full daily species counts can go into Wildlife Network&apos;s <Link href="/data" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">open data releases</Link>,
          which researchers cite, under the licence you pick.

          <li>It is checked with BirdWeather, then stored encrypted. It is used only to <b>read</b> your station&apos;s daily species counts; Wildlife Network never posts anything to your station.</li>
          <li>Only counts per species per day are kept. No recordings, soundscapes or individual detections.</li>
          <li>Your location is rounded to the precision you choose before anything is shown or published, and BirdWeather&apos;s own location privacy setting still applies.</li>
          <li>Withdraw here at any time with the same token, or by email: the token is forgotten and your station&apos;s data deleted. Releases already published keep their copy; later ones leave your station out.</li>
          <li>If you revoke the token at BirdWeather, your opt-in ends automatically and the data is deleted.</li>

          It is the token you entered in BirdNET-Pi or BirdNET-Go to connect to BirdWeather, and it is shown in your station&apos;s settings on{" "}
          <a href="https://app.birdweather.com" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">app.birdweather.com</a>. For a BirdWeather PUC, open the station in the
          BirdWeather app or website and look under its settings.
