          Wildlife Network is a free, non-commercial, open source project run by Arun Rajiah in Chennai, India. There are no accounts and no ads, and no data is sold.
          This page lists everything the site collects. Questions or requests: <a href="mailto:arunrajiah@gmail.com" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">arunrajiah@gmail.com</a>.
        </p>

        <H2>Visit statistics</H2>
        <p>
          Every page loads Google Analytics, which counts visits so the project can show funders and researchers how it is used. It records the pages you view, the
          features you use (choosing a species or animal class, playing a year, downloading a CSV, showing coverage), your approximate location at city level,
          your device and browser, and the site you came from. It sets cookies (named <code className="text-slate-200">_ga</code>) to recognise a returning browser.
          Google processes your IP address to do this. Advertising features are off. Detailed visit data is kept for 14 months and then
          deleted by Google; reports keep only totals after that. Google&apos;s own policy:{" "}
          <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.

        </p>

        <H2>The question box</H2>
        <p>
          If you ask a question, its text is sent to Google&apos;s Gemini API to write the answer. That service is used on its free tier, under which Google may use
          what is sent to improve its products, so please do not include personal information. The question and answer are kept for 30 days, with a keyed hash of
          your IP address (not the address itself) to limit how many questions one visitor can ask, then deleted.
        </p>

        <H2>Stations and devices</H2>
        <ul className="mt-2 list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li><b>Registering a device</b> stores the name you give it, its type, an optional contact email, and a keyed hash of your IP address to limit sign-ups. The API key itself is stored only as a hash. A device registered through the device registry also stores its hardware serial number, which is never shown publicly.</li>
          <li><b>Device health reports</b> (battery, storage, temperature, uptime, connection type and signal, detections waiting to be sent, software versions) are kept for 30 days, and the latest one is shown on the stations page under the device name. They contain no detections and no location unless the device chooses to send one, which is never shown.</li>
          <li><b>Detections your device sends</b> (species, time, confidence, location rounded to about 1 km on the device, and the station name you chose) are shown on the map and in the API, kept as individual records for 30 days, and after that only as counts per species, 5 degree area and week. They may be included in open data releases under the licence you chose (CC BY 4.0 by default). No recordings are uploaded.</li>
          <li><b>BirdWeather stations that opt in</b> (at <Link href="/stations/join" className="text-cyan-400 hover:underline">/stations/join</Link>) give their station token, which is checked with BirdWeather, stored encrypted and used only to read that station&apos;s daily species counts; plus the name, licence, location precision and optional email they choose. Withdrawing, or revoking the token at BirdWeather, deletes the token and the station&apos;s data.</li>
          <li><b>Marine records</b> from OBIS (up to 12 months), Orcasound and Acartia (7 days each) are kept with the species, count, time, position and the dataset, hydrophone or platform that published them. The names, usernames, signatures, photos and comments of the people who reported Acartia sightings are not stored. Killer whale positions from Acartia, and sensitive species from OBIS, are rounded to 0.1 degree.</li>
          <li><b>BirdWeather stations</b> appear only as approximate positions (rounded to 1 degree) without names or identifiers; individual detections are kept for 3 hours (bat detections for 24). Stations that stop reporting are deleted after 30 days.</li>
          <li><b>iNaturalist and GBIF records</b> are public records used under their CC0 or CC BY licences; observers are credited as their publishers ask.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="alerts" className="mt-8 mb-2 text-xl font-semibold text-slate-100">Species alerts</h2>
        <p>
          If you ask to be emailed when a species arrives near you, the site stores your email address (encrypted), the species, the place name you typed and the
          5 degree square it falls in, the optional answer to &quot;I am a...&quot;, and a keyed hash of your IP address to limit sign-ups. The place name is looked up
          once with the Open-Meteo geocoder; no coordinates are kept. Emails are sent through Resend (United States), which processes your address to deliver them.
          Nothing is sent until you confirm; unconfirmed requests are deleted after 7 days. Every email has a link that deletes the alert at once. Your address is
          used for nothing else and never shared. The anonymous counts of alerts per species and per &quot;I am a...&quot; answer may be reported to funders.
        </p>

        <p>
          Signing in with ORCID (for study areas and reviews) stores your ORCID iD and the public name ORCID returns, and when you last signed in. A signed
          cookie keeps you signed in for 30 days; it holds only your iD and name. Study areas you create, their collaborators, and your reviews of arrival
          estimates are public, with your name and ORCID iD. An email you give for a study digest is stored encrypted and used only for that digest.
          A study proposal stores your name, email (encrypted), institution, the area and your question, read only by the maintainer. Ask us to delete any of
          it, or delete a study yourself.

          Vercel tells the site the approximate area of your IP address (a city, and a position this site rounds to whole degrees, about 100 km). It is used
          only to start the map near you and to suggest your town in the alert form, and it is not stored or logged.
        </p>
        <p>
          The site runs on Vercel and its database on Neon, both in the United States. Vercel processes IP addresses and request details to serve pages and protect
          the service, and keeps them in logs for a short time. No other cookies or tracking are used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reference recordings in species panels are streamed straight from xeno-canto.org, and only when you press play (the sonogram image loads with the panel).
          Your browser then contacts xeno-canto, which sees your IP address. To pick the recordings, this site sends xeno-canto the species name and, for most species,
          the continent in view. Never your location or a detection&apos;s coordinates. Your browser also sends this site the centre of the map rounded to
          whole degrees (about 100 km), used only to put recordings from that country first; it is not passed to xeno-canto, and it is not sent for sensitive species.

          you or your station, to hide a species or a location, or to withdraw a station. Requests are handled within two days. Data already published in a dated,
          citable release cannot be recalled from people who downloaded it, so future releases will leave it out. You have these rights under India&apos;s Digital
