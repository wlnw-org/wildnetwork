const doc = `# Wildlife Network open data release ${RELEASE_NO} (${today})

Weekly records of birds, bats, amphibians and insects on a 5 degree grid, with observation effort and seasonal arrival dates, from openly licensed records published through GBIF.org. Made by Wildlife Network (https://wlnw.org), methods version ${METHODS_VERSION}.

Weeks covered: ${range.first} to ${range.last} (weeks start on Monday). Licence: CC BY 4.0. Please cite this release and the GBIF datasets listed in datasets.csv.

## Changes since the previous release
- Methods ${METHODS_VERSION}: researchers signed in with ORCID can review the arrival estimates published on wlnw.org, and a species-cell pair is dropped there when at least two reviewers mark it a misidentification or a resident and they outnumber those who accept it. The arrivals in this file are computed from GBIF records alone and are not filtered by those reviews, so they can be compared with them.
- The year now runs to the week of 12 October 2026 (one week later than release 3).

## What is and is not included

- Included: records published to GBIF under CC0 1.0 or CC BY 4.0 only, classes Aves, Chiroptera (bats), Amphibia and Insecta, human observations and machine observations with coordinates and no geospatial issues.
- Not included: BirdWeather acoustic detections. Wildlife Network shows them on its map with BirdWeather's agreement, but redistribution has not been agreed, so they are left out of every release.

## Files

### weekly_records.csv (${weekly.toLocaleString("en-GB")} rows)
| column | meaning |
|---|---|
| week | Monday of the week (ISO date) |
| cell_lat, cell_lon | south-west corner of the 5 degree cell, in degrees |
| class | avian, bat, amphibian, insect (bats are the order Chiroptera, reported separately from mammals) |
| scientific_name | GBIF backbone canonical name of the species |
| gbif_species_key | GBIF backbone species key (join on this, not on the name) |
| vernacular_name | English name most checklists agree on, where one exists |
| records | number of GBIF occurrence records of the species in that cell and week |

### effort.csv (${effort.toLocaleString("en-GB")} rows)
All records of a class in a cell and week, the denominator for effort correction. A species' share of its class (records / effort records) removes most of the difference between busy and quiet places. Wildlife Network treats a cell-week as watched by observers at ${OBSERVED.MIN_EFFORT_WEEK} bird records (${OBSERVED.SMALL_MIN_EFFORT_WEEK} for other classes).

### arrivals.csv (${arrivals.toLocaleString("en-GB")} rows)
Seasonal timing per species and cell, from this data alone. arrival_low and arrival_high give a 90% interval for the arrival week, from re-detecting it on weekly counts redrawn 40 times with the series' own overdispersion (gamma-Poisson); arrival_support is the share of those redraws that found a season at all (below 0.5, treat the arrival as weak). arrival_week is the first week the species reaches a tenth of its seasonal peak share after at least six weeks below it, in a cell watched in the weeks before. peak_per_1000 is the peak share per 1,000 records of its class. Full definition and known limits: https://wlnw.org/methods

### taxa.csv (${taxa.toLocaleString("en-GB")} rows)
One row per species in this release: GBIF species key, name, English name, class, total records, cells and weeks with records.

To join other data (for example BirdNET or eBird names, which follow other taxonomies), match your names to GBIF keys with the GBIF species match service, https://api.gbif.org/v1/species/match?name=<name>, and join on gbif_species_key. Use the acceptedUsageKey where a name is a synonym.

### datasets.csv (${datasets.toLocaleString("en-GB")} rows)
The GBIF datasets whose records fall in the classes and weeks above, with DOIs, the dataset's own licence, and how many of its records were used (only records individually licensed CC0 or CC BY 4.0 are used, even where the dataset as a whole carries a stricter licence such as CC BY-NC). Cite them as GBIF asks: https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines

## How this release was made
- Code: https://github.com/wlnw-org/wildnetwork at commit ${COMMIT}, script scripts/release.mts; methods version ${METHODS_VERSION} (definitions at https://wlnw.org/methods).
- Weekly counts: GBIF occurrence search API (https://api.gbif.org/v1/occurrence/search), one facet query per 5 degree cell and week, facet=speciesKey, with license=CC0_1_0 and CC_BY_4_0, hasCoordinate=true, hasGeospatialIssue=false, occurrenceStatus=PRESENT, basisOfRecord in HUMAN_OBSERVATION, MACHINE_OBSERVATION, OBSERVATION, OCCURRENCE, and taxonKey 212 (Aves), 734 (Chiroptera), 131 (Amphibia), 216 (Insecta). Cells queried: every 5 degree cell with at least 10 such bird records in the 90 days before the cell list was built.
- Effort: the same counts summed over all species of a class per cell and week.
- Arrivals: computed from these counts alone by computeSeasons("gbif") in src/lib/phenology.ts.
- Records were accessed from GBIF between 3 and ${Number(today.slice(8))} October ${today.slice(0, 4)}; GBIF data changes as publishers update, so a rebuild later will differ slightly.

## Limits
Counts are records, not animals: they follow where and when people look and report. Coverage is uneven (strongest in northern and western Europe and North America); use effort.csv to judge it. GBIF receives records a week or two after they are made, so the most recent weeks are under-counted and are left out of this release.
