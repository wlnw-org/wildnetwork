# WildNetwork

**A live, open map of where birds and animals are, and where they are going.**

Live site: **https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com**

WildNetwork gathers wildlife detections from acoustic stations, camera traps and community observations into one open event stream, then looks for movement: species whose range centre is shifting, whose numbers are surging or fading, and who has turned up somewhere new. Weather is matched to each species day by day.

It is free, open source, and built so that anyone with a Raspberry Pi can contribute data.

## What you can do with it

- **See what is happening now.** A live map of detections from thousands of sensors, with a feed of the latest events.
- **Birds, bats, frogs, insects and mammals.** Switch class in the top bar. Each class is measured against its own kind, so bats are compared with bats from the stations that can hear them.
- **See what is changing.** Species moving north or south (per continent), species surging or fading against their weekly average, and first arrivals in a region.
- **Follow one species.** Daily counts, the drift of its range centre, temperature and wind where it is, and a week by week playback of its movement across a year.
- **Add your own sensor.** One command on a Raspberry Pi.
- **Use the data.** Everything on the map is available through an open read API.

## Contribute data from your own device

The step by step guide, for people who already have a device and for people starting from nothing, is at **[wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/contribute](https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/contribute)**. Stations that already report to BirdWeather are included automatically and should not install the agent as well.

Building a new station? The open **[WildNetwork Base](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildnetwork-base)** (Raspberry Pi, microphone, solar) identifies birds on the device and sends to WildNetwork by itself; flash its SD card image (beta) onto a Raspberry Pi and set it up from a phone or a browser.

If you run BirdNET-Pi or BirdNET-Go on a Raspberry Pi:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/agent/install.sh | bash
```

That installs **[wdx-agent](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent)**, a single dependency free Python file (Apache 2.0). It finds your detection database, registers a device key, and starts sending. Your location is rounded to about 1 km on the device before anything is sent.

### Capture setups

| You have | You need | Guide |
|---|---|---|
| A Raspberry Pi and a USB microphone | [BirdNET-Pi](https://github.com/Nachtzuster/BirdNET-Pi) + wdx-agent | [Acoustic station with BirdNET-Pi](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#acoustic-station-with-birdnet-pi) |
| A Pi, mini PC, NAS or an RTSP camera with audio | [BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go) + wdx-agent | [Acoustic station with BirdNET-Go](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#acoustic-station-with-birdnet-go) |
| A trail camera | [SpeciesNet](https://github.com/google/cameratrapai) + wdx-agent | [Camera trap with SpeciesNet](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#camera-trap-with-speciesnet) |
| An ultrasonic recorder (AudioMoth, Song Meter Mini Bat) | [BatDetect2](https://github.com/macaodha/batdetect2) + wdx-agent | [Bat detector with BatDetect2](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#bat-detector-with-batdetect2) |
| A table exported by Kaleidoscope, SonoBat or similar | wdx-agent's `csv` source | [Any detections table](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#any-detections-table-csv) |
| Any other detector (Frigate, MegaDetector, a custom model) | Write WDX events to a file, or POST them | [Anything else](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#anything-else-write-wdx-to-a-file) |

Hardware lists, configuration, privacy settings and troubleshooting are in the [wdx-agent README](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent#readme).

### Push directly, without the agent

Get a key, then POST [WDX 0.1](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildlife-detection-exchange) events as one JSON object, a JSON array, or NDJSON:

```bash
curl -X POST https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/api/v1/register \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"my-station","source":"other"}'

curl -X POST https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/api/v1/events \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer wn_..." \
  -H "content-type: application/x-ndjson" \
  --data-binary @events.wdx.ndjson
```

Keys are tied to one source system. Events are validated against the WDX schema, and sending the same `eventId` twice never creates a duplicate.

## How it works

```
 Capture                         Exchange                           Observe
 -------                         --------                           -------

                                                          +--> events (live window, PostGIS)
 Pull connectors           ----->  map to WDX           --+        |
 (BirdWeather, iNaturalist)                                        v
                                                          species_daily / species_weekly
 BirdWeather aggregates    ----->  rollups per species,            |

                                                          insights, species pages, map
 Open-Meteo, Wikipedia     ----->  weather and species media
```

- **One format.** Every record, whatever its origin, becomes a WDX event. Connectors never write to tables directly.
- **Live window plus rollups.** Raw events are kept for the live map. History is kept as counts per species, per 5 degree cell, per day and per week, which is what movement analysis needs and stays small.
- **Movement is measured, not drawn, and corrected for effort.** Every measure uses a species' share of all detections in a cell, never its raw count, so more stations do not look like more birds. The definitions, thresholds and known limits are published at **[wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/methods](https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/methods)**.

## Open API

All read endpoints are public and need no key.

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v1/events?from=&to=&species=&bbox=w,s,e,n&source=&minConfidence=&limit=` | GeoJSON of detection events |
| `GET /api/v1/deployments` | GeoJSON of sensor sites with 24 hour counts |
| `GET /api/v1/species?hours=24&q=robin` | Species ranked by detections |
| `GET /api/v1/species/{scientific name}` | 30 day series, range centre, weather |
| `GET /api/v1/species/{scientific name}/movement` | Weekly frames for the past year |
| `GET /api/v1/arrivals?species=&lat=&lon=&format=csv` | Arrival, peak and departure week per species and cell ([validated](https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/validation)) |

Please credit the underlying data sources when you reuse data, see [Data sources and licensing](#data-sources-and-licensing).

## Run your own instance

Requirements: Node.js 22+, pnpm, Docker (for local Postgres with PostGIS).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wlnw-org/wildnetwork && cd wildnetwork
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env.local
pnpm db:up            # Postgres 16 + PostGIS on port 5433
pnpm db:migrate       # applies drizzle/*.sql in order, safe to re-run
pnpm backfill 14      # 14 days of daily rollups from BirdWeather (about 7 minutes)
pnpm pull 60          # live pull every 60 seconds, leave running
pnpm dev              # http://localhost:3000
```

Optional: `pnpm backfill:weekly 52` fills a year of weekly history for the movement playback. It is slow, roughly two minutes per week.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm db:up` / `pnpm db:migrate` | Start the database, apply migrations |
| `pnpm pull [seconds]` | Run the pull connectors on a loop (`0` runs once) |
| `pnpm backfill [days]` / `pnpm backfill:weekly [weeks]` | Build history from BirdWeather aggregates |
| `pnpm key:create "<name>" [source]` | Issue a push key by hand |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` / `pnpm test` | Checks that CI runs |

### Self-host with Neon and Vercel

The public site runs this way, and it fits in free tiers to start.

1. Create a [Neon](https://neon.com) project (or add Neon from the Vercel Marketplace: `vercel integration add neon`). PostGIS is available on Neon; the first migration enables it with `CREATE EXTENSION postgis`.
2. Put the pooled connection string in `DATABASE_URL`.
3. Apply the schema: `DATABASE_URL=... pnpm exec tsx scripts/migrate.mts`.
4. Build history: `DATABASE_URL=... pnpm exec tsx scripts/backfill.mts 14`. Rollups keep the database small: about 200 million detections fit in a few hundred thousand rows.
5. Deploy the app to Vercel (`vercel --prod`) with `DATABASE_URL` and `CRON_SECRET` set.
6. Schedule the pull and rollup endpoints (below). Neon scales to zero when idle, so the first request after a quiet period takes about a second.

**Ask box (optional).** Set `ASK_ENABLED=true` to switch on plain language questions, answered by an AI model that can only read this site's own data through four lookups (see [methods](https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com/methods#ask)). The free route needs no payment card: create a key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), leave billing off, and store it as `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` in your host's secret store (`vercel env add GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY production`), never in a file. Without that key the app uses the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway), which needs no key on Vercel but does need a card on the account.

**Analytics (optional).** Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID` to a Google Analytics 4 measurement id. Visitors are asked first, and nothing is loaded from Google unless they allow it. Leave it unset for no analytics at all.

**Deploying elsewhere.** Any Node host with a Postgres + PostGIS database works. The public site runs on Vercel with Neon. Set `DATABASE_URL` and `CRON_SECRET`, run the migrations against the production database, and schedule `GET /api/cron/pull` every few minutes and `GET /api/cron/rollup` hourly with `Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET` (see [.github/workflows/ingest.yml](.github/workflows/ingest.yml)).

If you run a modified version as a network service, you must make your changes available under the same license.

**Data** shown on the map belongs to its sources and keeps their terms:

## Reference recordings from Xeno-canto

Species panels on the map have a **Listen** block with up to two reference recordings from [xeno-canto](https://xeno-canto.org), so you can hear what a station detected. Xeno-canto agreed to this use by email.

- **Choice.** The server asks the [XC API v3](https://xeno-canto.org/explore/api) for the species (genus and epithet; we do not store subspecies) at quality A or B, preferring the continent in view and falling back to anywhere. It then ranks by quality, sound type (song, then call; echolocation for bats) and length (10 to 60 seconds, closest to 30, first), with the two clips from different recordists where possible.
- **Audio stays on xeno-canto.** The player is a plain `<audio preload="none">` pointed at the file URL xeno-canto returns, and the sonogram is hot-linked too. Nothing downloads until you press play, and only one clip plays at a time. We never copy, trim, re-host or re-encode a recording, which is why ND (no derivatives) licences are fine to show.
- **Withdrawn recordings.** Recordists can take a recording offline at any time. A clip whose audio no longer loads is hidden, and the cache refreshes within 7 days.
- **Credit.** Under each clip: recordist, location and country, the XC catalogue number linked to its page, and the licence linked to its deed, then the line "Recordings courtesy of xeno-canto.org".
- **Non-commercial.** WildNetwork is a non-commercial project, so NC licensed recordings can be played. A commercial fork must not show NC recordings.
- **Caching.** Results (including "none found") are cached per species and continent for 7 days in the `xc_recordings` table, with a day of CDN caching on top, to keep requests to xeno-canto low. If xeno-canto is slow (4 second timeout) or down, the panel loads as usual without the Listen block, and nothing is cached.
- **Sensitive species.** The browser only ever sends a continent name, never coordinates. For species listed in `scripts/sensitive_species.txt`, even the continent is dropped and xeno-canto is queried by species alone.
- **Key.** Set `XENO_CANTO_API_KEY` (from your xeno-canto account page) as a server-side environment variable, for example `vercel env add XENO_CANTO_API_KEY`. It is never sent to the browser or committed. Without it, the Listen block stays hidden.
## Marine data

Three open marine sources sit on the map beside the land data, as their own **Marine** class and a **Marine records** layer that can be switched off in the legend. Each source's licence status, polling, retention and privacy rules live in one file, `src/config/sources.json`, read by both the site and `scripts/aws-export.py`.

| Source | What | Polled | Kept |
|---|---|---|---|
| [OBIS](https://obis.org) (`connectors/obis.ts`) | Marine occurrences, human and machine observations | Daily, at most 10 pages of 1,000 | 12 months, at most 25,000 rows |
| [Orcasound](https://www.orcasound.net) (`connectors/orcasound.ts`) | Hydrophone whale detections; the hydrophones show as stations | Every 20 minutes | 7 days |
| [Acartia](https://acartia.io) (`connectors/acartia.ts`) | Marine mammal sightings by people | Every 30 minutes | 7 days |

- **OBIS.** Paged with `after` (records come in id order, which is random, so a capped walk is an even sample). The first backfill (`pnpm backfill:obis`) takes the India box (76 to 85 E, 5 to 16 N, about 4,000 records in a year) and then a sample of the last 12 months worldwide, stopping at the row cap and logging row counts and database size. Each walk restarts daily, so new India records arrive every day. `MachineObservation` becomes a machine record with an unspecified model; everything else is a human observation. No model, version or score is invented.
- **Licences.** OBIS licences are per record and followed as published: CC0 and CC BY go into the main data, CC BY-NC is shown and exported only under `noncommercial/`, anything else is skipped and counted in the run log. Orcasound and Acartia have not confirmed a licence yet, so their records are tagged `unknown-pending`: shown on the map with credit, kept out of rollups (and so out of the CSV downloads), and out of the AWS export (tested in `scripts/test_aws_export.py`). Switch `licence` in the config once permission arrives.
- **Duplicates.** OBIS republishes many GBIF and iNaturalist records. Records are matched on Darwin Core `occurrenceID` plus `institutionCode` (iNaturalist observations on their observation number); the first copy is kept and the other source is credited on it ("Also in OBIS dataset ...").
- **Orcasound.** OrcaHello detections are machine records with model "OrcaHello", version unknown and no score (the API gives none); listener reports are human observations. "Whale" is recorded as Cetacea at order level unless a listener names the species plainly (never a guess). Vessel detections are counted in the run log, not shown; "other" is skipped. Positions are the hydrophones' public sites.
- **Acartia.** Human sightings with the source's `trusted` flag and the number of animals. Common names map to scientific names through the editable `SPECIES` table in `connectors/acartia.ts`; unknown names are kept as "unmapped" and logged. Observer ids, signatures, witness usernames, photo links and the free-text comments (which often name the observer) are not stored. `created` is UTC (checked against the feed's GMT timestamps).
- **Sensitive species.** Southern Resident killer whales are endangered and live positions can draw boats, so Acartia and Orcasound killer whale records (and Orcasound whale detections, which are almost always killer whales) are shown 24 hours late, and Acartia killer whale sightings are rounded to 0.1 degree when stored. OBIS records of taxa in `scripts/sensitive_species.txt` (sea turtles Cheloniidae and Dermochelyidae, dugong, sawfishes Pristidae, and any species added there) are rounded to 0.1 degree when stored. All delays and rounding are in the config.
- **Credit.** Every record carries its credit line and link: "Data: OBIS (obis.org), dataset <title>" to the dataset page, "Data: Orcasound (orcasound.net)" to the hydrophone's page, "Data: Acartia (acartia.io), via <platform>".
- **API.** `/api/v1/marine?days=365&perCell=40&bbox=w,s,e,n` returns the marine layer, spread evenly over space; `/api/v1/events` also returns marine records in its window.

## Part of an open wildlife toolkit

Eight open source projects for listening to, identifying and mapping wildlife. They work together, but you rarely need more than one or two. Start from what you want to do:

| I want to | Use | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| See where birds and wildlife are moving, or download the data | [WildNetwork](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildnetwork) (this project) | The live map and open data: [wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com](https://wildnetwork.arunrajiah.com) |
| Build a monitoring station from open hardware | [WildNetwork Base](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildnetwork-base) | Software and a ready-to-flash SD card image (beta) for the open WildNetwork station (Raspberry Pi, microphone, solar) |
| Share detections from a BirdNET-Pi, BirdNET-Go, camera trap or bat detector you already have | [wdx-agent](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wdx-agent) | One small program that sends your station's detections. BirdWeather stations are already included and need nothing |
| Follow your own station on your phone | [BirdEcho](https://github.com/arunrajiah/birdecho) | Android app for BirdNET-Pi, BirdNET-Go and BirdWeather stations |
| Identify a sound you just heard | [WildEcho](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildecho) | Phone app: record a clip, get ranked species |
| Run your own sound identification server | [wildecho-api](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildecho-api) | Self-hosted species identification from audio, on CPU, no API keys |
| Check camera trap predictions before you use them | [SpeciesNet Studio](https://github.com/arunrajiah/speciesnet-studio) | Self-hosted review of SpeciesNet results, then send them to WildNetwork |
| Make your own software or device produce or read detections in a common format | [WDX](https://github.com/arunrajiah/wildlife-detection-exchange) | The open format for one AI wildlife detection; maps to Darwin Core |

**How this one fits.** WildNetwork is where detections come together. It takes WDX from WildNetwork Bases, wdx-agent, SpeciesNet Studio and WildEcho, alongside BirdWeather, GBIF and iNaturalist, and turns them into the map, arrival dates and open data releases.

**How they connect:** stations (a WildNetwork Base, BirdNET-Pi, BirdNET-Go, camera traps) produce detections; wdx-agent sends them in the WDX format, SpeciesNet Studio adds a human check for camera traps, and WildNetwork maps them. Connected today: wdx-agent, the WildNetwork Base, SpeciesNet Studio and WildEcho (if you switch sharing on) send to WildNetwork, BirdEcho shows WildNetwork arrivals near your station, and WildEcho uses wildecho-api. Planned: Base setup in BirdEcho.

## Name and logo

The code is open source (AGPL v3). The name "WildNetwork" and the logo are not part of the code licence: forks that run as a public service should use their own name and logo. See [TRADEMARKS.md](TRADEMARKS.md).

## Contributing and governance

Contributions are welcome: new connectors, better movement analysis, design, documentation, translations, and above all data.

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): how to set up, what to work on, how to add a connector
- [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md): who decides what, and the commitments that do not change
- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
- [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md): reporting vulnerabilities and sensitive species concerns

## Roadmap

- More sources: Movebank GPS tracks, GBIF camera trap datasets (Camtrap DP), weather radar migration (NEXRAD, OPERA)
- Species level alerts: first arrival of the season, unusual movement nights
- Context layers for long term analysis: land use, agriculture and climate indicators
